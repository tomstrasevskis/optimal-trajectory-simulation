# Optimal Trajectory Simulation

This Python program simulates and visualizes the motion of an object launched from a moving transport to a target point in a two-dimensional plane. It identifies the optimal launch angle that minimizes the total travel time for the object to reach the target.

## Features
- Real-time visualization of the simulation.
- Automated calculation of the optimal launch angle.
- Configurable parameters such as transport speed, object speed, and target coordinates.
- Dark-themed graphical interface using `matplotlib`.
